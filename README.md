# 🐭 Vole Machine

## 🌟 Project Overview

**Vole Machine** is a simple simulation of how a basic computer works, built using object-oriented programming (OOP) principles. The goal of this project is to help understand the core parts of a computer, like how it reads and processes instructions, stores data, and performs basic operations.

It’s designed as a small educational tool to visualize the behind-the-scenes of a computer’s thinking process. You can load instructions, store values, move data around, and even do simple calculations – just like a real computer does, but in a much simpler way!

## 🧩 What’s Inside?

This project breaks down the idea of a computer into smaller parts:

- **Memory** – Think of it as the computer’s notepad where it stores information.
- **Registers** – Tiny spaces inside the computer that hold data temporarily.
- **ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit)** – The part that handles basic math and logic operations.
- **Control Unit** – It’s like the manager that tells each part what to do and when.
- **CPU (Central Processing Unit)** – The brain of the computer that runs everything.
- **MainUI** – A simple way to interact with everything, run instructions, and see results.

## 🚀 What Can You Do with It?

- Load a file with instructions and run it
- View what’s happening inside the machine step-by-step
- Perform small operations like addition, data movement, and bitwise actions
- Reset the machine and start over at any time

## 🎯 Why This Project?

This project was created as a way to practice building something with OOP and to better understand how computers actually work. It's great for students or anyone curious about computer architecture in a very hands-on way.
